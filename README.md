I maintain a [reading list](https://nnix.com/reading). This list is generated statically from .md files with some header data, as is usual for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). Since I'm not going to make these files manually like a meat robot, I keep a script to parse a CSV of them into .md files. This is that script. Make a lambda out of it, build it and keep it as a shortcut on your desktop, whatever. It's simple and it works.
